Illustration of the relationship between:
(1) essential BC correction; (2) external nodal force; (3) surface & body force, (4) element force and (5) reaction force.
procedure:
(1) put external nodal load in GLOBAL F vector;
(2) put equivalent surface & body force in LOCAL foe vector;
(3) put essential BC correction in LOCAL fde vector, compute total force fee vector;
after solving free dofs:
(4) assign free dofs;
(5) compute element force and put in LOCAL fde vector, compute fee;
(6) compute reaction force through balance law.
